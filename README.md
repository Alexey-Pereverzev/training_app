# Training Management System

This is a modular Java 21 application built using **pure Spring Core (without Spring Boot)**. It manages trainees, trainers, and training sessions in memory using Spring dependency injection, annotations, and in-memory storage.

## Features

- Manage profiles for **Trainees** and **Trainers**
- Manage **Training sessions** between them
- Load initial data from CSV files at startup
- Generate unique usernames and random passwords
- Modular architecture following **SOLID**, **KISS**, and **DRY** principles
- Main file demonstrating proper data initialization
- Structured logging at multiple levels (`INFO`, `WARNING`, `SEVERE`)
- Unit tests with **JUnit 5** and **Mockito**

## How to Build and Run

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Alexey-Pereverzev/training_app.git
cd training_app
```

### 2. Build the project

```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

### 3. Run the application

```bash
./gradlew run
```

Output will include logs and entity details loaded from CSV.

---

## Running Unit Tests

```bash
./gradlew test
```

Test coverage includes:
- TraineeServiceImpl
- TrainerServiceImpl
- TrainingServiceImpl
- CredentialsUtil

You can find test classes under:
```
src/test/java/org.example.trainingapp/
```

## Example Logs

```
INFO: Created trainee: Alina.Iskakova
WARNING: Trainer not found: ID=123
SEVERE: Critical error during data loading
```

---

## Notes

- Credentials (username/password) are generated dynamically and stored in-memory.
- No external DB is used â€” all data is handled with Spring-managed maps.
- Usernames are generated with duplicates prevented
- Passwords and other sensitive data are **never** logged; only usernames, IDs, or non-confidential fields appear in logs.
- Although Springâ€™s `BeanPostProcessor` was considered, data loading is performed with `@PostConstruct`. This guarantees no risk of calling methods on partially initialized beans.
- 100% test coverage of services and utils

### Design Patterns Used
The project incorporates several established design patterns:

- **DAO** â€“ abstracts in-memory data operations via `TraineeDao`, `TrainerDao`, and `TrainingDao`.
- **Service Layer** â€“ encapsulates business logic through `TraineeService`, `TrainerService`, and `TrainingService`.
- **Facade Pattern** â€“ `TrainingSystemFacade` provides a unified interface for accessing multiple service layers.
- **Factory Pattern** â€“ `YamlPropertySourceFactory` dynamically loads configuration from YAML files.

### Property Placeholder Configuration
Spring externalises all config values through a classic **Property Placeholder** chain:

- `@PropertySource("classpath:application.yaml", factory = YamlPropertySourceFactory.class)` loads yaml properties with a custom YAML factory. 
- A `@Bean` of type `PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer` activates placeholder resolution.
- Any field annotated with `@Value("${property.path}")` is injected at startup, e.g.
   ```java
   @Value("${trainee.data.path}")
   private Resource traineeCsv;      // â†’ resources/data/trainees.csv
